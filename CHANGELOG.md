- `RandomTest` doing Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test to match random numbers with their ideal probability distribution.

## [ 0.6.1 ] - [ 2023-02-01 ]

### Added
- Linux/ARM64 Python wheel and Linux/ARM64 test workflow (gcc/Release).
- `classical not` gate is back.
- `state` section in JSON now contains a new entry `norm` which is the square of the modulus of the complex number.
- C++ integration test.
- All gates can be controlled (including `prep`, `measure`). This is not new but was accidentally removed in 0.6.0.
- New Python API `execute_string` and `execute_file` without having to create `qxelarator.QX()`
  and returning user-friendly Python type.

### Changed
- `results` section in JSON contains integers instead of floats (those integers being the number of occurrences).
- In relation to previous point, `results` only relates to measurement register averaging,
  and no longer to quantum state when doing a single shot.
  For that, use the "state" section in the JSON.
- Output float precision is 8 decimals instead of 6.

### Fixed
- README.

### Removed
- Most Python tests. Already covered in C++ integration test, and they didn't check much anyway.


## [ 0.6.0 ] - [ 2023-01-19 ]
Almost a complete rewrite. No functional change except it's faster.

### Added
- Ability to easily implement any quantum gate by simply giving an arbitrary unitary matrix in `Gates.h`.
- Performance speedup using a single thread.
- Some proper linear algebra primitives using template metaprogramming.
- `abseil-cpp` dependency for `flat_hash_map`.
- Ability to compile the simulator with a maximum number of qubits.
  In the future this will be using templates as well to switch data structures based on the input quantum circuit.

### Changed
- Quantum state is stored as a sparse array implemented using a `flat_hash_map` from `abseil-cpp`.
- C++20 in place of C++14.
- Code style: camel case.

### Removed
- OpenMP and multithreading.
- SSE, AVX and other intrinsics.
- `get_measurement_outcome` and `get_state` methods. Now accessible via JSON output.


## [ 0.5.5 ] - [ 2023-01-12 ]

### Added
- `set_string` method to parse a cQASM string directly instead of a cQASM file.

### Fixed
- Issue #118: quantum state is always displayed, as well as measurement register averaging.

 
## [ 0.5.4 ] - [ 2023-01-06 ]

### Added
- Tests for `measure` gate.

### Changed
- Switch to sequential/simple `measure` gate (as part of the fix for issue #114).

### Fixed
- Issues #91 and #114.

### Removed
- QFT implementation (never instantiated, so no functional change).
- `qx-server` no longer exists, together with the network libraries.
- "Microcode" generation functions (never used either).
- Parallel gates in `gate.h` (they were executed sequentially).
- Some unnecessary and/or obsolete code.


## [ 0.5.3 ] - [ 2023-01-02 ]

### Added
- Python 3.11 support.


## [ 0.5.2 ] - [ 2022-12-7 ]

### Fixed
- Python versions on Linux.

### Removed
- Python 3.6 support.


## [ 0.5.0 ] - [ 2022-11-15 ]

### Added
- `measure_all` gate. Does no longer measure each qubit separately.
- `-j <filename>` CLI option to output JSON to a file.
- Possible to use the simulator without OpenMP.

### Changed
- Move to C++11: smart pointers, etc.
- Format of output has been changed.
  You no longer need to add a `display` gate to output the quantum state at the end of the circuit.
- Use the new libqasm API instead of the old one.
- Output complex amplitudes when not averaging measurement register.
- Do not add automatically a `measure_all` when doing measurement averaging. Average the measurement register only.

### Fixed
- Close input file when done.
- Code style has been completely fixed automatically with clang-format.
- Headers no longer include `.cc` file.
- Move implementations to `.cc` files instead of headers.

### Removed
- Most preprocessor macros, e.g., for gate creation.
- A lot of old and useless code, and a lot of dead code.


## [ 0.4.2 ] - [ 2021-06-01 ]
