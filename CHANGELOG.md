# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [ 0.6.1 ] - [ 2023-02-01 ]

### Added

- Linux arm64 Python wheel and Linux arm64 test workflow (GCC-Release)
- "classical not" gate is back
- "state" section in JSON now contains a new entry "norm" which is the square of the modulus
of the complex number
- C++ integration test
- All gates can be controlled (including prep, measure). This is not new but was accidentally removed in 0.6.0.
- New Python API execute_string and execute_file without having to create qxelarator.QX() and returning user-friendly Python type

### Changed

- Fixed README
- "results" section in JSON contains integers instead of floats (those integers being the number of occurences)
- In relation to previous point, "results" only relates to measurement register averaging, and no longer to quantum state
when doing a single shot. For that, use the "state" section in the JSON.
- Output float precision is 8 decimals instead of 6

### Removed
- Most Python tests - already covered in C++ integration test, and they didn't check much anyway

## [ 0.6.0 ] - [ 2023-01-19 ]

Almost a complete rewrite. No functional change except it's faster.

### Added

- Ability to easily implement any quantum gate by simply giving an arbitrary unitary matrix in Gates.h
- Performance speedup using a single thread
- Some proper linear algebra primitives using template metaprogramming
- Abseil-cpp dependency for flat_hash_map
- Ability to compile the simulator with an set maximum number of qubits - in the future this will
be using templates as well to switch data structures based on the input quantum circuit

### Changed

- Quantum state is stored as a sparse array implemented using a flat_hash_map from Abseil-cpp
- C++20 in place of C++14,
- Code style: camel case

### Removed
- OpenMP and multithreading.
- SSE, AVX and other intrinsics.
- get_measurement_outcome and get_state methods. Now accessible via JSON output.

## [ 0.5.5 ] - [ 2023-01-12 ]

### Added

- set_string method to parse a cqasm string directly instead of a cqasm file

### Changed

- Fixed issue #118: quantum state is always displayed, as well as measurement register averaging

### Removed
- 

## [ 0.5.4 ] - [ 2023-01-06 ]

### Added

- Tests for measure gate

### Changed

- Fixed issues #91 and #114
- As part of #114, switch to sequential/simple measure gate

### Removed

- QFT implementation (never instantiated, so no functional change)
- qx-server no longer exists, together with the network libraries
- "Microcode" generation functions (never used either)
- Parallel gates in gate.h (they were executed sequentially)
- Some non-needed and/or obsolete code

## [ 0.5.3 ] - [ 2023-01-02 ]

### Added

- Python 3.11 support

### Changed

-

### Removed

## [ 0.5.0 ] - [ 2022-11-15 ]

### Added

- "-j <filename>" CLI option to output JSON to a file
- Possible to use the simulator without OpenMP.

### Changed

- Measure_all gate added; does no longer measure each qubit separately.
- Move to C++11: smart pointers, etc.
- Format of output has been changed. You no longer need to add a "display" gate to
output the quantum state at the end of the circuit.
- Now uses the new Libqasm API instead of the old one.
- Output complex amplitudes when not averaging measurement register.
- Do not add automatically a measure_all when doing measurement averaging;
average the measurement register only.

### Removed

- Most preprocessor macros. E.g. for gate creation.
- A lot of old and useless code was removed. A lot of dead code removed.

### Fixed

- Close input file when done.
- Code style has been completely fixed automatically with clang-format.
- Headers no longer include .cc file.
- Moved implementations to .cc files instead of headers.
